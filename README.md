The aim of this study is to see if the Humor Styles Questionnaire can be used as a predictor of gender. This investigation tries to
figure out this phenomenon by using the Humour Styles Questionnaire(made by Martin et al 2003) which distinguishes positive and negative
humour styles. We will use a data set made from the responses of the questionnaire which consisted of 1071 entries and 39 categories one
of which was gender. To see if our prediction is true, we examine and implement several machine learning algorithms, such as KNN, Logistic
Regression and SVM. When analysing the accuracy scores to measure the modelsâ€™ performances, the results proved the hypothesis that
humour styles could be used to predict gender to an extent.
